Now need to generate the following for regions/counties:

> A Home Page - links to each country and a World Countries pages which will list all world flags (current FlagIt.html page)E

>Country Pages
>These will consist of a heading of the country name and flags for each region/state/province
>May be another content page linking to individual countries/regions (e.g United Kingdom -> England, Scotland, Wales, NI)
>Will not go any further for this version (no cities sub-regions)
  
> World Flags can be generated using the same method "World Flags" as country name and existing country flags as regions

>Given a path to a directory 
>Take Directory Name and map Country Name
>Open the Directory
>Open the text list inside
>Each line in the list corresponds to a region of the country, use to insert img and set title
>Save resulting html as country_name.html

>Will also need to generate javascript to bind handlers
>handlers will be identical for every page
>make existing script generic, wrap into a setup function which takes in country name and no. regions
>use country name as the name for the check_array and no. regions as size for blank check array
>write a call to this script in html body using extracted directory name and table size as parameters

>First test - Attempt to recreate existing FlagIt.html page as World_Flags.html and a basic home page which links to it.
>Update javascript and test on current implementation, ensure function call works correctly
>Create a World_Flags folder, insert flag_list.txt and correct flag images.
>Run python script, expect -> FlagIt.html (home page) which links to World_Flags.html
