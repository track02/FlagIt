Now need to generate the following for regions/counties:

>A Home Page - links to each country and a World Countries pages which will list all world flags (current FlagIt.html page)
>Simple list of links will be okay for now.

>Country Pages
>These will consist of a heading of the country name and flags for each region/state/province
>May be another content page linking to individual countries/regions (e.g United Kingdom -> England, Scotland, Wales, NI)
>Will not go any further for this version (no cities sub-regions)

> World Flags can be generated using the same method "World Flags" as country name and existing country flags as regions

>Given a path to a directory
>Take Directory Name and map to Country Name
>Open the Directory
>Open the text list inside
>Each line in the list corresponds to a region of the country, use to insert img and set title
>Save resulting html as country_name.html

>Will also need to generate javascript to bind handlers
>handlers will be identical for every page
>make existing script generic, wrap into a setup function which takes in country name and no. regions [DONE]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>FlagIt.js is used to setup event handlers and initialise the storage array when needed
>It's been wrapped inside a function called init_setup(<array_name> <array_size)

>Because inline function calls are not allowed, we'll instead load in a uniquely generated javascript file for each country which runs the init_setup procedure in FlagIt.js

>Generate a js file <CountryName>.js which is a single line call to init_setup(<country_name> <no. flags>)
>this simply calls FlagIt.js

>This allows handler bindings and ensures the correct storage array to be initialised at the correct size and set/get when required

>Load in this script after the table

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>First test - Attempt to recreate existing FlagIt.html page as World_Flags.html and a basic home page which links to it.
>Update javascript and test on current implementation, ensure function call works correctly [DONE]
>Update python script to generate both HTML and associated Javascript files
>Create a World_Flags folder, insert flag_list.txt and correct flag images.
>Run python script, expect -> FlagIt.html (home page), World_Flags.html and World_Flags.js

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If going further than regions/provinces, directores will contain sub directories

>If a directory instead contains other directories
>Create a contents page as directory name, with links for each child directory <sub_directory>.html
