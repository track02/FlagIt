# FlagIt

A simple web extension checklist for flag collectors.

Use the .crx file in the Chromium folder or the .xpi file in the Firefox folder to install.

Should be able to just drag onto browser addons page, tested in Firefox and Chromium.

## Chromium release is outdated, does not have regional areas


## TODO

Optimisations:
- boolean array over int array
- loading images from external source (e.g. this github page) instead of bundling with addon
- further image compression, extracting only when needed
- world map with toggling countries
