# FlagIt

A simple web extension checklist for flag collectors.


## Building

Run the firefox/chrome build scripts located inside the Builder folder, this will create a new directory with the needed files and package the contents, web-ext is required.

## Installation

### Firefox 

Add to firefox from Mozilla's add-on site: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/flag_it/?src=ss

New versions will be downloaded automatically as add-on updates. Currently V0.39

### Chromium

Note: This release is outdated and does not include regional flags.

Use the .crx file in the Chromium folder and drag onto browser addons page.


## TODO

- Remove thumbs.db files (generated by windows) [DONE]
- loading images from external source (e.g. this github page) instead of bundling with addon
- world map with toggling countries
