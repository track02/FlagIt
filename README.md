# FlagIt

A simple web extension checklist for flag collectors.

Download blank_flags.xpi (no flags found) or complete_flags.xpi (all flags found) and drag into browser to install.

Should work in Chrome and Firefox, any problems leave an issue.


## TODO

Consider using individual pages and displaying flags alphabetically.

Consider adding sub-sections for each country to cover internal county/state/etc flags.
